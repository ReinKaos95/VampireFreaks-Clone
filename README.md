## UPDATE, IMPORTANT!
Considering the following slow trace of development and the lack of time to use laravel due the job, I've decided to re-work this site as a PHP project

## Components

- [PHP](https://www.php.net)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

## About this proyect

This project consists of recreating the most famous gothic culture website, Vampirefreaks, based on the design of the years 2004-2007 (2000 as starter), mostly.
Originally made with basic web languages for the time (HTML / CSS / JS and PHP), I have decided to make a kind of clone.
It will include things like forums and a kind of social network, cults and all the things that I remember from those dreaded years, obviously this will take time because the social network was closed in 2020, so I will make an effort to recreate this site through by WayBack Machine.
I will try to keep the simplistic design of those years mentioned, with some blending.

## Summary
The first version, (VampireFreaks 2000), it's just for display
<br>
The final result (VampireFreaks 20004 or 2007 website, it depends) will be deployed in Heroku
